UT Coding Bootcamp - HW5
Use the GifTastic App at https://thomasrios.github.io/GifTastic/
## What is this?
This is an application that taught me alot about APIs and AJAX. This is a simple app that will display 10 gifs of basketball players when a button with their name is clicked. Searching for a player in the search bar will create a button with the user input. That button will use the giphy api to search for GIFs with that input and display them on the page. 

## How to play?
Click [here](https://thomasrios.github.io/GifTastic/) to play! Simply click a basketball players name to display 10 unique GIFs and search for your favorite player to add him to the team. 

## Features:
- Pressing a button with the name of a basketball player displays GIFs of that player
- Giphy APIs have been integrated to specifically search their database based on user input
- HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and API keys were used to make this app
- Searching a term (or player) creates a button and adds it to the page
- Ratings are displayed under each GIF
